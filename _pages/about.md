I am currently a final-year PhD student in [ILCC](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) at the University of Edinburgh. My supervisor is [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/). 

I am broadly interested in natural language processing and machine learning. My recent research interests focus on the following topics:

- **Semantic Parsing**: bridging the gap between human languages and formal/programming languages to enable interaction with machines via human languages.

- **Compositional Generalization**: endowing neural networks with compositionality for better generalization in downstream NLP tasks such as semantic parsing and machine translation.

<!-- 

During my PhD, I primarily focus on **endowing neural networks with compositionality for better generalization in downstream NLP tasks such as semantic parsing and machine translation.** I believe that the ability to robustly re-compose exsiting knowledge and skills in novel scenario is critical to many high-level cognitive abilities beyond language.

I have attempted to approach this problem from two different perspectives:

- Marrying symbolic structure with neural nerworks ([Semantic Tagging](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.88.pdf))

- Devising new neural achitecture learning disentangled representations ([Dangle](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.293.pdf), [R-Dangle](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05982.pdf)) -->
